## About

This is a shiny app to use for "Harmonic Syntax" the explanations for which are under development.

This is an OT tabulator for a cyclic syntax with operations Merge, Label, and Agree. All the operations and the required functions are saved in harmonic_syntax.R

TabulatorInterface.R is the shiny app under development.

## version info: broken alpha :)

Further development notes:

-   Add fields for uploading numerations

-   Add options to save the derivations to distinct folders based on the numeration

-   Reactive UI for step-wise use (upload numeration, go through the derivation, continue with weight optimization, output a latex file for evaluation steps and forest trees for winning candidates)
