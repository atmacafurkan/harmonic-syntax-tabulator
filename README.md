## About 
This is a very early start to making a shiny app for a harmonic syntax tabulator with Merge, Label, and Agree as operations. Intended use is to automate output generation and file creating to feed into programs like MaxEnt Grammar Tool for constraint learning.

Intended functions:
- Take a table as numeration, with items specified for their features, merge conditions, and agree conditions
- Give options to activate markedness constraints for each feature
- Enable selecting which operations count as steps
- Output a tsv file for use in other software for learning OT & Harmonic grammars
- Output a latex file with tree representations and OT-tableaus
